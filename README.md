PicBucket is an app where in you can discover hd images from all over the internet. Search for a keyword and see a tonne of results in a single tap.

Why stop at same old boring search feature? When we provide you with a feature capable of recognising captured images and fetching the most accurate results for it!

## How does it work?

We have used the [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/documentation) for quick backend solution. For image detection integration we have used Firebase ML kit library.

## Objectives

- Fetch images from online.
- Implement a Navigation Drawer with 6 items.
- Push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.

## Features 
#### Add on features include :

> Data persistence with Hive.
> Caching of Images.
> Scalable Architecture.
> User Friendly UI.

### Tech Stack

>PicBucket uses these frameworks and libraries :

* [Flutter] - Cross-Platform framework for building mobile and web apps!
* [Provider] - The most recommended flutter state management library.
* [Firebase ML Kit] - Prebuilt Machine Language made by firebase to be used in projects! (We used the image labeler from this kit)
* [Hive] - A library for local data persistence in flutter applications.
* [Image Picker] - Used to get images from the users' device via either the gallery or camera.

And of course PicBucket itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/ishitb/Apptitude_online) on GitHub.

##### Requirements to run on your system

PicBucket requires Flutter version 1.20.0 or higher on the [master channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).
